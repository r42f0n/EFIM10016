Question   5Consider the following small economy:   In this   economy,   we   have   one   farm   that   produces   flour.   The farm sells the flour to a   bakery   for   £6.   The   farm   employs   workers   who   receive   £1   in   wages.   The farm pays £3 in taxes to the Government.   Using the flour   from   the   farm,   the bakery   workers   create   scones.   The   bakery   sells   scones   for   £21   to   the   local   inhabitants   and   exports   scones   for   £9.   The bakery also imports clotted cream from the neighbouring   economy   for £5.   The bakery   workers   receive   £12 in   wages, and   the   bakery   pays   £   10   in   taxes.   The   public   sector   provides   a   health   service and   a   school   for   all   inhabitants.      The   Government pays   the health workers   and   teachers   £22   in   wages.   The public sector has no expenses beyond these wages.   The inhabitants   of   this   economy   pay £9 in taxes.   They also buy clotted   cream   from   the bakery   for   £5.   The bakery   is   owned by   a   woman in the neighbouring economy.   What is the   sum   of   all profits   generated   in   this   economy   (the operating surplus)?

Question   17If   we   had   an   exchange   rate   of   1.21   US   Dollars   to   the   British   Pound   yesterday,   and   an   exchange   rate of   1.42 US   Dollars   to   the   British   Pound   today,   did   the   British   Pound   then   appreciate,   depreciate,   or stay constant compared to   the US   Dollar?
Question   18Consider   the   following   small   economy:   In   this   economy, we   have   one   farm   that   produces   flour.   The farm   sells   the   flour   to   a   bakery   for   £83.   The   farm   employs   workers   who   receive   £15   in   wages.   The farm   pays   £57 in   taxes   to   the   Government.   Using   the   flour   from   the   farm, the   bakery   workers   create scones.   The   bakery   sells   scones   for   £71 to   the   local   inhabitants   and   exports   scones   for   £96.   The bakery also imports clotted cream from the neighbouring economy for   £65.   The bakery workers   receive   £42 in   wages, and   the   bakery   pays   £22   in   taxes.   The   public   sector   provides   a   health   service and a school for all   inhabitants.   The   Government   pays   the   health   workers   and   teachers   £109   in   wages.   The public sector has no expenses beyond these wages.   The inhabitants   of   this   economy   pay   £30 in   taxes.   They   also   buy   clotted   cream   from   the   bakery   for   £65.   The   bakery   is   owned   by   a woman in the neighbouring economy.   What is the income inequality in this   economy   in   terms   of   the   wage   share, that   is   the   share   of   income   generated   (wages   and   profits)   that   goes   to   wages?
Question   19Consider   the   following   economy.   In   the   year   2013,   the   economy   had   213,779   unemployed   women and   420,085 unemployed   men.   The   year   after, the   number   of   unemployed   women   was   235,502   and the   year   of   unemployed   men   was   505,221.   In   year   2014,   there   were   4,597,147   employed   men   and 1,799,085 employed women, compared to 4,321,923 employed   men   and   1,691,377   employed   women   in   year   2013.   What   was   the   total   percentage   change   in   the   unemployment   rate   from,   2013   to   2014?
Question 20Consider   the   following   economy.   In   the   year   2013,   the   economy   had   213,779   unemployed   women and   450,085 unemployed   men.   The   year   after, the   number   of   unemployed   women   was   237,044   and the year of unemployed men was 493,500.   In the year 2014, there were 4,390,729   employed   men   and   1,718,304 employed women, compared to 4,321,923 employed   men   and   1,691,377   employed   women   in the year 2013.   How much did the change in the number   of unemployed women   contribute   to   the   overall   change   in   the   number   of   unemployed   from   2013   to   2014?

•   Group 5:   Wednesday   11:00 to   13:00:   France
Task   1Your   task   is   to   analyse   the   change   in   the number   of people   in your   assigned   country   since   the   1980s.   Your answer could cover topics   such   as   population   stocks   and   flows,   changes   in   fertility,   and life expectancy.   The task description is intentionally   vague.   You   decide   on   the   precise   time   periods   and   the   exact   focus   of   your   assignment.   Use   at   least   400   words   and   2   visualisations   for   this exercise.   All visualisations should be made from scratch using R.   You   can   use   data   from   Eurostat,   OECD, or the World   Bank.
Task   2Your task is to describe the development   in   unemployment,   inequality,   or   poverty   in   your   assigned   country.    You   decide   the   exact   period   to   study.    This   could   be   a   historical   period,   the   current   period, or both.   You can look at overall unemployment,   inequality,   and   poverty,   or   you   can   look   at   specific subgroups   (for example by age or gender).   You   can   also   study   whether   unemployment   and   inequality   are   correlated.   Use   at   least 400 words   and   2 visualisations   for   this   exercise.    All   visualisations   should   be   made   from   scratch   using   R.   You   can   use   data   from   Eurostat,   OECD,   or   the World Bank.

1970                                        1980                                        1990                                        2000                                        2010                                        2020The   figure depicts   inequality   in   the   United Kingdom since   the   1970s.    We   use   the   Gini   index   because   it   is   the   most suited   to understand changes in   inequality   over   time.    We use   data provided   by   the   World   Bank.   As   seen   by a rising   Gini index, it   is   clear   that   inequality   in   the   UK has   decreased   since   the   1970s.   This   shows   that as economies grow,   inequality   tends   to decrease.
